# The Reference Log, "reflog"

All this time you've been committing things, branching, doing whatever.
And Git's been watching you, listening like Big Brother, recording
everything you do.

And you can use this to your benefit.

Let's say you've done something like a hard reset because you wanted to
abandon the branch you were on.

But then, wait! You actually needed something from one of those commits
you just reset past! Is there any way to get back to it? There's no
branch there, and you can't remember the commit ID. And since it's not
an ancestor to anything, `git log` won't help you.

How can you get it back?
